This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the HDC2080, HDC2021 and HDC2010
low-power humidity and temperature digital sensor using the [`embedded-hal`]
traits.

This driver allows you to:
- Set the measurement mode. Temperature only or temperature and humidity. See: `set_measurement_mode()`.
- Make one shot measurement. See: `read()`.
- Read the data and interrupt status. See: `status()`.
- Trigger a software reset. See: `software_reset()`.
- Read the manufacturer ID. See: `manufacturer_id()`.
- Read the device ID. See: `device_id()`.

## The devices

The HDC2080 device is an integrated humidity and temperature sensor that
provides high accuracy measurements with very low power consumption in a
small DFN package. The capacitive-based sensor includes new integrated
digital features and a heating element to dissipate condensation and moisture.

The HDC2080 digital features include programmable interrupt thresholds to
provide alerts and system wake-ups without requiring a microcontroller to
be continuously monitoring the system. Combined with programmable sampling
intervals, a low power consumption, and a support for a 1.8-V supply voltage,
the HDC2080 is designed for battery-operated systems.

This driver is compatible with HDC2080, HDC2021 and HDC2010.

Datasheets: [HDC2080](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc2080.pdf), [HDC2021](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc2021.pdf), [HDC2010](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc2010.pdf)

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the device.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

```rust
use embedded_hal::blocking::delay::DelayMs;
use hdc20xx::{Hdc20xx, SlaveAddr};
use linux_embedded_hal::{Delay, I2cdev};

fn main() {
    let mut delay = Delay {};
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let address = SlaveAddr::default();
    let mut sensor = Hdc20xx::new(dev, address);
    loop {
        loop {
            let result = sensor.read();
            match result {
                Err(nb::Error::WouldBlock) => delay.delay_ms(100_u8),
                Err(e) => {
                    println!("Error! {:?}", e);
                }
                Ok(data) => {
                    println!(
                        "Temperature: {:2}Â°C, Humidity: {:2}%",
                        data.temperature,
                        data.humidity.unwrap()
                    );
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
